# economy-plugins
This is the archive of custom economy plugins made for Creators.TF.
Creators.TF was a community of servers dedicated to continuing to release new content for the Team Fortress 2 community; similar to what Valve used to do. Servers featured custom cosmetics, weapons, music kits, and contracts across several community-made content updates and events. The main purpose of this repository is to preserve some history of Creators.TF that many people didn’t get to see outside of the development team.

There are two major versions for the Sourcemod implementation of our economy. The first version was built from scratch by Moonly Days. It relied on our website to deliver item definition data. The second version was built by ZoNiCaL in an attempt to remove dependency on website API’s and to improve server stability. The second version of the economy was not fully completed before the servers shut down in April 2022. 

Included in this repository are the original source code files, include files, and gamedata for both major economy versions. Some plugins may require some external dependencies (e.g TF2Wearables), which will not be included. Plugin dependencies will be listed in the comments at the top of each plugin. Some minor code edits have been made for security purposes.

The code, gamedata, and includes in this repository are provided "as-is". We will not be making any further updates with SourceMod revisions, TF2 gamedata updates, or feature requests. We will not be providing any support with installing or using these plugins. If you have any questions, please contact ZoNiCaL#9740 on Discord.

Special thanks to all of the developers who contributed to the economy code.
